Introduction

This is a Python script that uses a neural network to predict the next number in a sequence of numbers input by the user. The script utilizes the Keras library, a popular deep learning library, to create and fit the model.

Requirements

Python 3.x
Keras (can be installed via pip install keras)

How to Use

Run the script by typing python numpred.py in the command line.
The script will prompt you to enter numbers between 1 and 10.
Enter as many numbers as you want, when finished type done to end the input.
The script will use the numbers you entered to train a model and predict the next number in the sequence.
Note
This script is just an example and may require some tweaking to suit your specific requirements. Also, this script uses LSTM (a type of recurrent neural network) which is used when the input data has a temporal aspect to it.

Please make sure you have the dependencies installed and python version is compatible with the libraries used in the script.
